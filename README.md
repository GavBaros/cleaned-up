## Getting started

In the project directory, install the NPM modules with:

### `npm install`

Then for a local development mode run:

### `npm start`

This allows Lerna to run both the `backend` and `frontend` folders locally in parallel.

## Tests

Change your terminal into the `backend` folder and run:

### `npm test`

I decided to only write tests for the `backend` as this is where the core business logic resides.
